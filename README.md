# uol-notes-template

A LaTeX template used for writing up my notes from my MSc degree. The format is inspired
by the work done by the late Gilles Castel. Every module inherits the same default
preamble, along with a module-specific preamble for module-specific commands.

## General Workflow

My writing work is done via GVim, with the vimtex plugin installed. During a lecture,
I start the compiler in continuous mode and write text as I go. After a lecture has
finished, the content is refined and math formulae and figures are added as needed.

For finished documents using this template, see my website: jackiewkr.neocities.org
